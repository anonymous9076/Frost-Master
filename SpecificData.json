      "description": [
        "Understand the difference between various oven types—such as conventional, convection, and microwave—and how each influences your cooking results. The way heat is distributed plays a major role in how evenly and quickly your food cooks.",

        "Convection ovens use a fan to circulate hot air, making them ideal for baking and roasting with even browning and faster cook times. In contrast, conventional ovens rely on radiant heat from top and bottom elements, offering a traditional cooking experience that’s great for many recipes.",

        "Gas ovens typically heat up faster and are preferred by chefs for their precise temperature control, while electric ovens offer consistent, dry heat that's ideal for baking. Some modern models even combine both in dual-fuel systems for the best of both worlds.",

        "Choosing the right oven type isn’t just about preference—it affects cooking speed, flavor development, and energy usage. Understanding these differences helps you select an oven that aligns with your cooking style, whether you’re a casual home cook or a culinary enthusiast."
